# Strategist at Heart, Analyst by Training, Marketeer in Action

Hi, I'm **Sujal Chorage** — a multidisciplinary Marketing Strategist, Pharmaceutical Brand Manager, Commercial Forecaster, and Data-Driven Analyst passionate about transforming data, insights, and creativity into measurable business growth.

I operate at the intersection of Brand Strategy, Data Analytics, and Digital Marketing, bridging strategic foresight with analytical precision and executional excellence.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Marketing Analytics (GPA: 3.95/4) at Pace University, I’m sharpening my expertise in predictive analytics, data visualization, and AI-driven automation—building the profile of a modern marketer who is as comfortable designing a brand strategy as training an ML model.
